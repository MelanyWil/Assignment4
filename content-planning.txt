MY ADVENTURES: (Paragraph and photos about some of the activities I have done this summer): 

My dad is a pilot and flight instructor. It's been quite awhile since I have been flying with him, so this summer I asked if he could take me up in the plane. While we were in the air he asked me if I wanted to fly the plane. I was terrified at first, but soon got the hang of it!

Grant's Farm has a really fun summer concert series and this year they added a drone show. I went with some friends and we had a blast. The drone show is a must see! 

I love a good float trip and this year one of my favorite local bands did a concert and float trip at BearCat Getaway. It was a fun weekend filled with music, dancing, friends and floating. Great time!

I have done some kayaking on different Missouri rivers as well as at Creve Coeur Lake, but this year we decided to try out the kayaks at Forest Park Boathouse. I was fun to paddle around the park and afterwards we enjoyed food from The Boathouse and a summer concert(another summer favorite).

I have always enjoyed a bit of theatre, but during the summer I love Shakespeare in the park and The Muny. I did both this year; This years production of Shakespeare was Twelve Night and I saw Chess for the first time at The Muny.

Every year I go to Lake of the Ozarks with my mom and spend a relaxing weekend floating in the water. 

On the way back from the lake my mom really wanted to stop at the river to hang out my family who had picked that weekend to have a river day. There are so many great spots in Missouri to hang out at the river and we have a few favorites within an hour to an hour an half of STL. 

Ever heard of The horseradish festival? Me either, but apparently Collinsville, ILL is the horseradish capital of the world. Another one of my favorite local bands was playing so we brought our chairs and enjoyed the music and food. 

My most recent adventure was a trip to Defiance Ridge vineyards near St. Louis, for an afternoon of fun with friends and another afternoon with SuperJam.
